# Carrier - A Messaging Service
With this project I seek to create a digestable messaging platform that includes all of the standard features, while
also enabling users to host their own serverside.

### Compiling into exe file
Note to self:
python script to exe can be done with the command
pyinstaller -F -noconsole "program.py"
